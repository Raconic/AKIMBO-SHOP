        <p>Akimbo was a fun side project I began last year. I've always had a passion to create my own brand and had plenty of time during covid. Akimbo was created to provide creative headwear to the youth. This brand was created to grow closer with my friends aswell as experience what it takes to buy, create and sell merchandise.  </p>
